ðŸš€Civitta Interview Task - WEB API application that returns country public holidaysðŸš€

First of all - it was first time using FastEndpoints (read about it in r/dotnet about a week ago and tried to use it here)

I understand the concept of docker and I understand how it works. However I do not have a lot of experience with it.

The task overall was quite big overall. I could do more validation. I could do more optimizations. Or clean up code. However I think it is enough to show what I can do.

2024-08-25 - no unit tests. gonna complete it on 2024-08-26.

Overall I spent around 6 hours. (commits may show a longer period of time, however I had a few errands to run that day ðŸ˜€ )
